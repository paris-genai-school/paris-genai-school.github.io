* **From Software Engineering to AI Researcher and Startup Innovator** - Anthony Coutant, *HephIA* <br>
Anthony Coutant is the Co-founder, Co-CEO, and CTO of HephIA, a startup developing innovative Generative AI solutions for the legal sector. With a diverse background that spans software engineering, AI research, and business management, Anthony’s career reflects a unique combination of technical expertise and entrepreneurial insight. <br>
Anthony began his journey with a master’s degree in MIAGE (Méthodes Informatiques Appliquées à la Gestion des Entreprises), which provided a strong foundation in software engineering and business management. His apprenticeship during this period equipped him with the practical skills needed to navigate the intersection of technology and business.<br>
Afterward, he pursued a PhD in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in unsupervised learning and graphical models applied to social networks. His academic career continued with a postdoctoral project on autonomous robotics in biology, where he developed AI for a robot capable of conducting real-world biological experiments. This work resulted in his being the first author of a publication in PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), one of the most prestigious scientific journals.<br>
In parallel, Anthony collaborated with industry leaders like Renault, Safran, and Thalès, applying exploratory AI to solve complex industrial challenges. These experiences demonstrated the potential for AI to scale beyond research applications.<br>
In 2017, Anthony co-founded HephIA, with the support of the SATT and the X-Up incubator at École Polytechnique. Initially focused on AI for industrial applications, the company pivoted toward Generative AI for the legal sector. Although HephIA is still in the process of reaching full commercial viability, Anthony and his team are refining their product in collaboration with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in the legal industry to ensure a successful market launch.<br>
Anthony’s trajectory illustrates the challenges and opportunities of transforming cutting-edge AI research into a scalable business. His blend of software development, AI expertise, and business acumen positions him to lead HephIA in tackling real-world challenges, from the lab to the legal sector.

* **Founding an AI Startup Right Out of School**, Tristan François, _Veeton_ <br>
Tristan François is the co-founder of Veeton, a startup specializing in generative AI for virtual try-on technology. A graduate of École Polytechnique and Télécom Paris, Tristan began working on virtual try-on during his final year at Télécom Paris as part of a research project. <br>
During a research internship in Montreal, Tristan worked on reinforcement learning applied to constraint programming. It was during this time that he discovered the field of virtual try-on. The following year, he tailored his academic curriculum to develop skills in generative AI, laying the groundwork for his future entrepreneurial venture. <br>
In 2023, shortly after completing his studies, Tristan co-founded Veeton. The startup faced the typical challenges of a new venture in a highly technical field. Since its inception, Veeton has focused on building a team, developing their initial product, and securing funding to support their growth and innovation in the AI-driven virtual try-on space.


* **MCF: a traditionnal academic journey in France**, Massinissa Hamidi, *IBISC, Université d'Evry, Université Paris-Saclay* <br>
Massinissa HAMIDI est maître de conférences à l'université d'Évry Paris-Saclay. Il a effectué un master en informatique à l’université Paris Diderot (actuelle Université Paris Cité) autour des logiciels sûrs avec un focus sur le design de compilateurs et l’étude de la sémantique des langages de programmation. Il a mené ses travaux de thèse en intelligence artificielle à l’université Sorbonne Paris Nord autour du méta-apprentissage. ATER à l’université de Picardie Jules Verne pendant un an, il rejoint par la suite le laboratoire LISSI à l’université Paris Est en tant que postdoctorant pour travailler sur des projets européens en collaboration avec le groupe ADP (Aéroports de Paris).  Les recherches de Massinissa HAMIDI portent sur le méta‐apprentissage, ou comment développer des agents qui apprennent à apprendre par eux-mêmes, avec des applications à l'internet des objets, la médecine personnalisée et aux données omiques.

* **From Software Engineer to Knowledge Graph Researcher: A Journey Through Industry and Academia** - Pierre-Henri Paris, *LISN, Université Paris-Saclay* <br>
I am an associate professor at Paris-Saclay University, with a PhD from Sorbonne University and postdoctoral experience at Telecom Paris. Before starting my academic career, I spent 10 years as a software engineer, which gave me a unique perspective on research challenges and industry needs. My research focuses on knowledge graphs, knowledge representation, and natural language processing (NLP).<br>
I began my PhD later in life, balancing academic demands with family, having my first child during my PhD and my second during my postdoc. I emphasize the importance of networking -- not only for finding a job but also for support throughout the journey. I would love to share insights on how to successfully navigate career transitions, balance personal life with research, and leverage your network to thrive in both academia and industry. <br>
