# Mentoring session 
## 5:30 PM - 6:30 PM - 24th of October 
Meet inspiring researchers and start-ups and ask them questions! 
What were their main difficulties? What are their motivation? 
How to create its start-up? Feel free!

How: Choose 2 mentors from the following list (a form is coming) and have ~20 minutes to chat with them in small groups. 

* **From Software Engineering to AI Researcher and Startup Innovator** - Anthony Coutant, *HephIA* <br>
Anthony Coutant is the Co-founder, Co-CEO, and CTO of HephIA, a startup developing innovative Generative AI solutions for the legal sector. With a diverse background that spans software engineering, AI research, and business management, Anthony’s career reflects a unique combination of technical expertise and entrepreneurial insight. <br>
Anthony began his journey with a master’s degree in MIAGE (Méthodes Informatiques Appliquées à la Gestion des Entreprises), which provided a strong foundation in software engineering and business management. His apprenticeship during this period equipped him with the practical skills needed to navigate the intersection of technology and business.<br>
Afterward, he pursued a PhD in Artificial Intelligence, specializing in unsupervised learning and graphical models applied to social networks. His academic career continued with a postdoctoral project on autonomous robotics in biology, where he developed AI for a robot capable of conducting real-world biological experiments. This work resulted in his being the first author of a publication in PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), one of the most prestigious scientific journals.<br>
In parallel, Anthony collaborated with industry leaders like Renault, Safran, and Thalès, applying exploratory AI to solve complex industrial challenges. These experiences demonstrated the potential for AI to scale beyond research applications.<br>
In 2017, Anthony co-founded HephIA, with the support of the SATT and the X-Up incubator at École Polytechnique. Initially focused on AI for industrial applications, the company pivoted toward Generative AI for the legal sector. Although HephIA is still in the process of reaching full commercial viability, Anthony and his team are refining their product in collaboration with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in the legal industry to ensure a successful market launch.<br>
Anthony’s trajectory illustrates the challenges and opportunities of transforming cutting-edge AI research into a scalable business. His blend of software development, AI expertise, and business acumen positions him to lead HephIA in tackling real-world challenges, from the lab to the legal sector.


* **From PhD Student to Full Professor: An Academic Journey in AI Across France** - Nadjib Lazaar, *LISN, Université Paris-Saclay* <br>
Nadjib Lazaar defended his HDR at the University of Montpellier in November 2022, marking a significant milestone in his academic journey. He holds an Engineer’s degree in Computer Science from Université Es-Senia d’Oran, Algeria (2007), where he graduated as valedictorian. His pursuit of knowledge continued with a Master’s degree and a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Rennes 1, completed in 2008 and 2011, respectively. <br>
Following his doctoral studies, Nadjib worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the INRIA-Microsoft Joint Centre in Paris-Saclay until September 2012, contributing to cutting-edge research in the field. He then participated as a postdoctoral researcher in the European ICON project (FP7 FET-Open) in Montpellier from 2012 to 2013, enhancing his expertise in AI and innovative technologies. <br>
Since 2013, Nadjib has held the position of tenured assistant professor at the University of Montpellier, where he co-headed the COCONUT team from 2018 to 2023. During the 2019/2020 academic year, he was seconded to CNRS for a year, further expanding his academic experience. <br>
Nadjib's research interests encompass Constraint Programming, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. He specializes in areas such as Constraint Acquisition, Declarative Data Mining, and Constraint-Based Software Testing, as well as AI for Neuro-Symbolic and Trustworthy AI systems. His collaborative work includes partnerships with institutions such as Simula Research Lab in Oslo, CEA Paris-Saclay, Inovacom, DeepLink Medical and SmarTesting. <br>
Nadjib’s career exemplifies a successful blend of academic achievement and practical application, positioning him as a prominent figure in the field of AI research and education. <br>
