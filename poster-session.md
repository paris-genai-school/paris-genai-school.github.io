# Poster session 

You can present your research, an open problem for which you would like advice, how you would like to apply generative AI to your topic, etc. 
As you wish! 

You will be asked to present your work during a short talk (2-3 minutes, 2-3 slides). 

We can print your poster if you send it to us before the 16th of October! 

Process:

* If you need printing, please send your poster to gs.isn@universite-paris-saclay.fr (cc) before the 16th at 6 PM. Let us know if you have any problems.
Some details :
  * There is no poster template. We need your poster in a PDF file of size A0.
  * If we print the poster, we want you to add the GenAI-School logo. ([https://paris-genai-school.github.io/Images/Logo_GenAI-SCHOOL.png](https://paris-genai-school.github.io/Images/Logo_GenAI-SCHOOL.png))
  * The list of posters will be on the website.
  * If you send us your PDF, we will add it to the website (except if you say otherwise). 
* If you don't need printing, please email your name, affiliation, PDF file (if you want us to put it on the website) and poster title to gs.isn@universite-paris-saclay.fr before the 18th at 6 PM.
