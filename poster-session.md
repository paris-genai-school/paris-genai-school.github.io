# Poster session 

You can present your research, an open problem for which you would like advice, how you would like to apply generative AI to your topic, etc. 
As you wish! 

You will be asked to present your work during a short talk (2-3 minutes, 2-3 slides). 

We can print your poster if you send it to us before the 16th of October!
