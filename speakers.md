* **[Xavier Alameda-Pineda](http://xavirema.eu/)** - Inria at University Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France <br/>
**Bio**: Xavier Alameda-Pineda is a (tenured) Research Scientist at Inria and the Leader of the RobotLearn Team. He obtained the M.Sc. (equivalent) in Mathematics in 2008, in Telecommunications in 2009 from BarcelonaTech, and in Computer Science in 2010 from Univ. Grenoble-Alpes (UGA). He then worked towards his Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computer Science, and obtained it in 2013, from UGA. After a two-year post-doc period at the Multimodal Human Understanding Group, at the University of Trento, he was appointed to his current position. Xavier is an active member of SIGMM, a senior member of IEEE, and a member of ELLIS. He was the Coordinator of the H2020 Project SPRING: Socially Pertinent Robots in Gerontological Healthcare and is co-leading the “Audio-visual machine perception and interaction for companion robots” chair of the Multidisciplinary Institute of Artificial Intelligence. Xavier’s research interests are at the crossroads of machine learning, computer vision, and audio processing for scene and behavior analysis and human-robot interaction.

* **[Merouane Debbah](https://www.ku.ac.ae/college-people/merouane-debbah)** - Khalifa University <br/>
**Bio**: Mérouane Debbah is a researcher, educator and technology entrepreneur. Over his career, he has founded several public and industrial research centers, start-ups and is now Professor at  Khalifa University of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi and founding Director of the KU 6G Research Center. He is also the Chief Scientific AI Advisor at the Technology Innovation Institute. He is a frequent keynote speaker at international events in the field of telecommunication and AI. His research has been lying at the interface of fundamental mathematics, algorithms, statistics, information and communication sciences with a special focus on random matrix theory and learning algorithms. In the Communication field, he has been at the heart of the development of small cells (4G), Massive MIMO (5G) and Large Intelligent Surfaces (6G) technologies. In the AI field, he is known for his work on Large Language Models, distributed AI systems for networks and semantic communications. He received multiple prestigious distinctions, prizes and best paper awards (more than 40 IEEE best paper awards) for his contributions to both fields and according to research.com is ranked as the best scientist in France in the field of Electronics and Electrical Engineering. He is an IEEE Fellow, a WWRF Fellow, a Eurasip Fellow, an AAIA Fellow, an Institut Louis Bachelier Fellow and a Membre émérite SEE. His recent work led to the development of NOOR (upon it release, largest language model in Arabic) released in 2022, Falcon LLM (upon its release, top ranked open source large language model) released in 2023 and the Falcon Foundation in 2024. The Falcon Model Series and The Falcon Foundation have positioned the UAE as a global leader in the generative AI field. He is a member of the Marconi Prize Selection Advisory Committee.

* **[Gaël Richard](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/gael-richard)** - IPP/Télécom Paris <br/>
**Bio:**  Gaël Richard received the State Engineering degree from Telecom Paris, France in 1990, the Ph.D. degree and Habilitation from University of ParisSaclay respectively in 1994 and 2001. After the Ph.D. degree, he spent two years at Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, in the Speech Processing Group of Prof. J. Flanagan, where he explored innovative approaches for speech production. From 1997 to 2001, he successively worked for Matra, Bois d’Arcy, France, and for Philips, Montrouge, France. He then joined Telecom Paris, where he is now a Full Professor in audio signal processing. He is also the co-scientific director of the Hi! PARIS interdisciplinary center on Artificial Intelligence and Data analytics. He is a coauthor of over 250 papers and inventor in 10 patents. His research interests are mainly in the field of speech and audio signal processing and include topics such as signal representations, source separation, machine learning methods for audio/music signals and music information retrieval. He received, in 2020, the Grand prize of IMT-National academy of science for his research contribution in sciences and technologies. He is a fellow member of the IEEE and the past Chair of the IEEE SPS Technical Committee for Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing. In 2022, he is awarded of an advanced ERC grant of the European Union for a project on machine listening and artificial intelligence for sound.
